# updated version of moonmask that uses just opencv and numpy instead of python imaging library

## I'm using these other libraries for practice, and because they feel more intuitive when working with images. 

## You can run the scripts in moonart_scripts/ if you'd like to see some examples. There's some funkiness in how I have this set up, so to run those scripts, you'd have to run '''pip instal -e .''' first. This installs the current directory as a module in editable format, from what I understand.
